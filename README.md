Image processing using Laplacian operators and Circular Doubly Linked List in Python.
# Laplacian Image Processing using CDLL

Demonstrates the use of Laplacian operators for edge detection in images, along with implementation using Circular Doubly Linked Lists (CDLL).

## ðŸ“· Key Features
- Used Laplacian operator to highlight edges
- Implemented CDLL to manage pixel traversal

## ðŸ§ª Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV (optional, if used)
- Data Structures (CDLL)

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context
- Course: i-MADS (Semester 2)
- NIIT University
